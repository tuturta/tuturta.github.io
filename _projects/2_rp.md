During my internship at **Reef Pulse**, I developed and implemented **deep learning models** for detecting and classifying bioacoustic events around coral reefs. Reef Pulse focuses on continuous monitoring of reef ecosystems using soundscapes and AI to provide scalable and objective assessments of reef health.  

My work addressed the challenges of **multi-class and multi-scale audio analysis**, enabling the processing of audio tracks of arbitrary length and capturing events from diverse sources. I implemented a **Transformer-based HuBERT model**, capable of detecting multiple species (e.g., parrotfish, groupers) and human-made noises (boats) with high reliability. I also designed an **iterative, agile workflow** to optimize the annotation process, doubling the size of the dataset from 40,000 to 70,000 validated annotations, ensuring balanced representation across time and environmental conditions.

This project enhanced my skills in **marine biology, acoustics, Python programming, object-oriented design, PyTorch, and project management**, including agile methodologies and collaborative tools like GitHub and Notion. I also gained experience navigating the constraints of **R&D in a company setting**, balancing rapid iteration with rigorous data validation.
