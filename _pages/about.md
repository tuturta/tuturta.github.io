I’m Arthur Tabary, a computational scientist with a lifelong curiosity for both nature and technology. My passion for the environment started in childhood, sailing in the Mediterranean, and has since expanded from oceans to forests, mountains, and polar regions. Over time, this fascination evolved into a professional pursuit: applying AI and data science to address environmental challenges, from climate change to ecosystem conservation.

During my studies at EPFL, I combined physics, modeling, and computational science with a focus on machine learning and data-driven solutions. I have contributed to a variety of applied projects, from deep learning for dynamic aperture measurements at CERN, to bioacoustic classification of coral reefs at ReefPulse, to robotic imitation learning inspired by animal locomotion. My Master’s thesis and ongoing work at EERL explore autonomous environmental sensing in polar regions using tethered balloon systems.

Alongside science, cinema has been a constant passion. Although I chose a professional path in computational science, I continue to direct and produce films as a cinematographer, keeping storytelling alive as a personal and creative complement to my research. I find that both science and cinema share a common thread: curiosity, observation, and the desire to communicate complex realities in compelling ways.

I’m motivated by projects that bridge technology and nature, using AI and data science to tackle real-world environmental challenges.
